# ds-python-logging
A mini package to register `atexit` logging. Currently log files are cluttered with `stdout` and `stderr` messages and it can be hard when coming to a new project to understand the flow of a program to trace the issue. `eulogy` allows custom messages and function calls to be logged in order right at the point the interpreter crashes.
